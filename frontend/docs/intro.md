# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook** — your interactive guide to mastering the cutting-edge field of embodied artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world through robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital domains, Physical AI systems must:

- **Perceive**: Process real-world sensor data (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, force sensors)
- **Reason**: Make intelligent decisions under uncertainty and real-time constraints
- **Act**: Control actuators and motors to manipulate objects and navigate spaces
- **Learn**: Adapt behaviors through experience and human feedback

Humanoid robotics takes Physical AI a step further by embodying intelligence in human-like form factors, enabling robots to operate in environments designed for humans.

## Course Overview

This quarter-long intensive course provides hands-on training in:

- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: Industry-standard framework for robot software development
- **Computer Vision & Perception**: Deep learning for object detection, tracking, and scene understanding
- **Motion Planning & Control**: Path planning, inverse kinematics, and trajectory optimization
- **Simulation & Digital Twins**: Training and testing in realistic virtual environments (Isaac Sim, Gazebo)
- **Hardware Integration**: Working with NVIDIA Jetson, depth cameras, and humanoid platforms
- **Foundation Models**: Leveraging LLMs and vision-language models for robot intelligence

## Who This Course Is For

This textbook is designed for:

- **Graduate students** in computer science, robotics, or electrical engineering
