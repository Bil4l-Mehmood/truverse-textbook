## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools and libraries that help you build robot applications across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

:::info Beginner Tip
If you're new to robotics, think of ROS 2 as an operating system for robots - just like Windows or Linux for computers, ROS 2 provides the tools robots need to function.
:::

### Key Concepts

**Nodes**: Programs that perform specific tasks (like reading sensor data or controlling motors)

**Topics**: Communication channels where nodes send and receive messages

**Services**: Request-response communication between nodes

**Actions**: Long-running tasks with feedback

## Installation Guide

### For Ubuntu/Linux (Recommended for ROS 2)

```bash
# Add ROS 2 repository
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl gnupg lsb-release ubuntu-keyring

# Download ROS 2 GPG key
curl -sSL https://repo.ros2.org/ros.key | sudo apt-key add -

# Add ROS 2 repository
sudo apt-repository "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main"

# Install ROS 2
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

:::tip Advanced Users
For production environments, consider using Docker containers to isolate your ROS 2 workspaces and dependencies.
:::

### For Windows

:::warning Note
Windows support in ROS 2 is experimental. Ubuntu/Linux is recommended for development.
:::

```bash
# Download pre-built binaries from https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Windows-Install-MSI.html
# Or use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Ubuntu
```

### For macOS

:::caution macOS Support
macOS support in ROS 2 is limited. Consider using Docker or a Linux VM.

## First ROS 2 Program

### Your First Node

Create a file called `hello_ros.py`:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class HelloNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('hello_node')
        self.get_logger().info('Hello from ROS 2!')

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = HelloNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Run it:

```bash
python hello_ros.py
```

:::info Intermediate Tip
To run this with GPU acceleration, ensure your system has CUDA installed and ROS 2 is compiled with GPU support.

## Understanding the ROS 2 Ecosystem

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **ROS Client Library (rcl)** | Low-level communication |
| **rclpy** | Python bindings for ROS 2 |
| **rclcpp** | C++ bindings for ROS 2 |
| **DDS Middleware** | Handles message passing between nodes |

### Package Structure

```
my_ros_package/
├── package.xml          # Package metadata
├── setup.py            # Python package setup
├── src/
│   └── my_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── my_node.py
└── tests/
    └── test_my_node.py
```

:::tip GPU Optimization
If your GPU is NVIDIA RTX (24GB VRAM available), you can use CUDA acceleration for compute-intensive ROS 2 nodes. See the Advanced chapter for details.
